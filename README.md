# Lease Wizard


 ## Description
 * Since in Ontarioâ€™s highly regulated residential rental markets, landlords must comply with complex rules that are confusing to landlords and tenants alike. Unfortunately, the vast majority of leases are long documents written in legalese that:
    * Leave people confused or misinformed about their legal rights and obligations
    * Contain terms that parties never read, are ambiguous, or may not comply with the law
    * Leave people feeling vulnerable and upset increasing the risk of conflict
 * Our project offers a streamlined, intuitive and user-interative interface for landlords and tenants to fill out the Ontario Standard Form Lease.
