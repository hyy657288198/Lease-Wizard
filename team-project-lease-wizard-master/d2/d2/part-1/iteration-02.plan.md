However, he may mot good at frontend but it is fine, since we have people who are good at frontend. He may not know many languages like react but he can learn it quickly. He may has less experience working on multi-languages task. For non-software related work, each team member has evenly distributed on this work, since we always divide non-programming into seven parts evenly.
      * Irene: She is good at backend and she is good at lower level programming. So she has a good understanding about programming languages. The frameworks and development methodologies are the strength for her. She may not good at frontend, but she can learn it. And she may not good at multi-tasking programming.

However, she may not good on backend because of the lack of experiences. And she may not good at react, but she knows skills about frontend, so we believe react is not a problem for her. Also, she may not good at paper work which is ok, since we are a team. We can work together. For non-software related work, each team member has evenly distributed on this work, since we always divide non-programming into seven parts evenly.



#### Team Rules


Communications:
  * Our team uses facebook and skype to connect online, and we also have at least two short meetings per week.
  * We would like to have at least one meeting with our partner per week, and we will use Slack to connect with them online. 
  * We may ask simple or small questions through Slack first, if it's still not clear for us, we will ask it during the weekly meeting. And we will also discuss our goal for next week in the meeting.
 
 
Meetings:

  * For the weekly partner meeting, we will discuss our questions one or two days before the meeting and find optimum 2-4 team members to attend it.
  * After the partner meeting, we will let those members went to the meeting tell us the detail information about that meeting (this is the internal meeting which contains all 7 team members).
  * For the meetings between our team members, we meet every Monday after 301 tutorial, and if some members could not come, we will send them the video recording and meeting notes, or we could have voice meeting or video meeting online.
 
Conflict Resolution:

  * Indecisions:
      * We will try to make the decision most of team members agree, or prepare 2 or more plans for our partner and ask which one they prefer most.
  * Non-responsive team members
      * We have a group on Facebook, and we all agree on telling other members our schedule of next week, and we will keep 2 meetings every week, so we can connect everyone easily.
      * If someone is non-responsive in the future, we will try the connect information we have to reach that member, and ask him/her to finish his task. If he/she is that kind of non-responsive person, group leader will contact him everyday to make sure he makes some progress. If it doesn't work, we will tell our TA this situation.
  * Divide-in-Opinion
      * Other team members will be the moderators, every team member needs to acknowledge this conflict. Members involved need to talk about the issue, give out their opinion and solutions.
      * As a team, we will discuss the impact the conflict is having on team dynamics and performance, and choose the most reasonable and optimal solution.

#### Artifacts


All 7 members use the platform 'Monday' to keep track of everything about
our project. Our artifact contains 5 parts:

* A main table to display the detailed information
![](./img_for_md/art1.png)
![](./img_for_md/art2.png)
![](./img_for_md/art3.png)
It consists of two major parts: Things to do and Done. Each entry of the table corresponds to an event, an entry displays the people that are invovled, status and priority of the event, as well as the due date and timeline.

* A schedule that visualizes all the events
![](./img_for_md/art4.png)

* A general to-do list for milestones and a more specific to-do list for events that need to be done in two weeks.
![](./img_for_md/art5.png)

* A battery to show the overall progress and a corresponding Llama farm to cheer people up;)
![](./img_for_md/art6.png)

####

* Tracking

We check our to-do lists and the main table regularly.

* Task Assignments

Firstly we evalute every task, decide its priority and focus. Based on our firstly evaluation, we assign tasks to members, evaluate the results of the past tasks to adjust our assignments. In addition, people can comment on the event if they think something is not working properly. We will hold meetings to discuss the issues, then make some changes based on the comments and our discussion.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

 * Workflow  
   1. create a local branch for the feature/page that need to work on  
   2. make changes and commits to that feature/page branch  
   3. review and test by the developer on the feature/page branch  
   4. merge the feature/page branch to master branch  
   5. resolve conflict if it occurs (since most features/pages are independent, conflicts rarely occur)  
   6. weekly code review meeting  
   
   In this workflow, each developer is responsible for his/her own independent feature/page branch.   
   There is less interaction between different developers' work and fewer conflicts as a result, the developer can also focus on a specific functionality with fewer communication costs.  
   Our weekly code review meeting also ensures the quality of our code.  

* Naming Standards
    In the state of App.js where we store all the data of user's input in our web, we follow the Naming Standards as below:  

    "_date" suffix for all the dates variables  
    "_amount" suffix for all the integer amount variables  

* Deployment
    Heroku: we simply commit and push the code to the Heroku repository, then Heroku will automatically build and deploy the web application.  

    The process of deploying our React App on Heroku is easy and efficient. The developer can focus more on the code instead of infrastructure

    * Those are useful artifacts since these are the proof of how we divid the project in a high-level understanding way.

  * Choosing the design pattern for the porj and draw the sketch of the patterns, so we can write our code bases on the structure below and we can have a clear code structure.
    * Those are useful artifacts beacuse these are the sketchs of our data structure and these artifacts show the basic relationships between each js files.

  * Having discussion with partners and exchange ideas about the project, so we can make and design our project better:
    * This is useful since this shows how we communicate with our partner and how we design or enhance the project ideas.

  * Planning ahead and schedule works for each week, so we can work ahead and we may not need to do some rush work.
    * These artifacts are important since those show how we organize our work.
