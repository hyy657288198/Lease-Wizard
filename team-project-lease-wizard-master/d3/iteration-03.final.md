### Changes from you `product.md`

<!-- List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines.  -->

* Significant change 1:

  * Change about the acceptance criteria and project feature:

    * New feature: Progress Bar
      
      During the d3 reflection meeting with our partner, we find out that we have forgot this feature from the prototype. Since they said that this is one of the most important feature for the project, we add this to our task list and successfully complete this feature.

    * New feature: Pop Out information view

      During the pre-demo reflection meeting with our partner, they pointed out that the pop out information view for money pages is important, so we increase the developing priority for this and implement perfectly.

    * Reduced feature: Multi views for Timeline

      Because of our dynamic updated developing task lists and our partner reflection, we reduce the previous acceptance for showing timeline as both a listview and a calendar view, now we only have a listview timeline.

    * Modified feature: Navigation Bar Showing Progress 

      Since our partner has given us the misleading starter code, seperating the navigation component from the content component, it is hard for us to update the navigation check list function when filling the website. So we just show the progress at the bottom progress bar.

* Significant change 2:

  * Change about our tech stack:
    
    * Data Storage at DataBase => Not required for saving data

      In the initial developing idea for our group, we want to use mySQL and Python with flask framework as back-end building tech stack. However when descussing with our partner, they just want our website as demo use, not recommand for build a huge database to store use data. So for all features of our website, except for the Export to PDF, we only use React to fulfil the need.

    * Complete front-end design => Client-server design to implement ExportToPDF feature

      Since our partner didn't need us to build the backend part for our project, we thought we would not need the server. Unfortunately, we have tried all methods to complete the ExportToPDF without server from all rescourses but fail to finish it. So we have to bring server to our development. Now we use Server to perfectly implement their most important featrue: ExportToPDF.


### Handoff plan

<!-- Describe your plan for handing off your product and all technical assets to your partner -->

 <!-- * Will you have a handoff meeting? If so, what will be discussed? -->
* We have invited our partners to have a handoff meeting, but because of their tight schedue, they haven't response to our invitation. If we could succesfully schedule a time, we will have a handoff meeting. If not, we will provide a document/README to demonstrate the handoff details. 

 <!-- * What assets/artifacts will you be handing off to your partner (e.g. codebase, deployment tools, running application, task tracker, etc.)?  -->
   
* Since our partner needs to customize the legan term contents in the website view, we will both hand off our codebase and the deployed website, to let them fill in their contents. Also if they want our task accomplishment list, we can hand off our deliverable2 & 3 as a brief description.

 <!-- * How will you hand off these assets/artifacts? -->
   
* We will give them our Github repo permission to get our code package, and for deployed website, we will give them the link.

 <!-- * Does your partner have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop your product? How will that impact how you handoff the product? -->

* Our partners have their own Github repo, so it is easy for partners to maintain/keep/develop our product.
